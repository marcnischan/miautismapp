The chairs are shaped like cars and planes, and I believe some have a strap. There are TVs at each station and those provide a good distraction. They work super fast there since they specialize in kids' cuts."

We met with him in a private room, and he reviewed exactly what would happen in class, and went over some of the moves with my child. He was calm, reassuring and very good natured. Then my child joined the class and it was a great success. I highly recommend Quest Martial Arts!"
